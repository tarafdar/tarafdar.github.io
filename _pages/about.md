I am a PhD. candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto where I work in the High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Group advised by Prof. Paul Chow.
My research area is creating a scalable platform for heterogeneous computing within a data center with my primary focus being on FPGAs.
Within the last decade we have seen a trend in the integration of heterogeneous compute devices within the data center. 
However in order to harness the power of these devices at scale we need to look at ways to make them accessible.
I approach the accessibility problem of these devices at scale through the formation of an abstraction stack.
