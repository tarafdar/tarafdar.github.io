I am a PhD Candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).
My professional journey began in Toronto, specifically in the University of Toronto where I have completed my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in Computer Engineering. And now I'm in it for the long-haul with a PhD where I work in the High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Group advised by Professor [Paul Chow](http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~pc/).


Research Focus
------
My research interests spans multiple areas of computing with the overarching goal of making computing more accessible to users, what good are fast devices if they are too diffult to use?
My current focus has been making large heterogeneous clusters accessible to users through the use of abstraction layers. 
This research focus spans many areas of computing including cloud computing, distributed computing and FPGAs.


<!--
My main project is Galapagos which looks at creating a scalable platform for heterogeneous computing, particularly FPGAs, within a data center.
Within the last decade we have seen a trend in the integration of heterogeneous compute devices in the data center. 
However in order to harness the power of these devices at scale we need to look at ways to make them accessible.
I approach the accessibility problem of these devices at scale through the formation of an abstraction stack.
This is a layer cake of abstraction layers for hardware development in the cloud. Having to interface with a single hardware device is painful, what if you wanted to do that on the order of thousands? 
This project explores a multi-layer abstraction, starting with connecting FPGAs and CPUs to a common network backplane, abstracting away a single FPGA, forming a middleware for multiple FPGAs and programming layers and application layers on top of this. We provide a modular multilayer abstraction to give users the flexibility to choose which level of abstraction is appropriate for them.

Outside the Lab
------
I would like to believe that I am more than just my work. I enjoy reading (non technical papers as well), music (there was a time when I could play guitar, it is on my to do list to get back to it), martial arts, biking (when it is possible, I do live in Canada), and spending time with my friends and family (when I can find the time).
