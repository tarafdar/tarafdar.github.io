excerpt: 'We present an efficient multi-query event stream platform to support query processing over high-frequency event streams. Our platform is built over reconfigurable hardware -- FPGAs -- to achieve line-rate multi-query processing by exploiting unprecedented degrees of parallelism and potential for pipelining, only available through custom-built, application-specific and low-level logic design.'

We present an efficient multi-query event stream platform to support query processing over high-frequency event streams. Our platform is built over reconfigurable hardware -- FPGAs -- to achieve line-rate multi-query processing by exploiting unprecedented degrees of parallelism and potential for pipelining, only available through custom-built, application-specific and low-level logic design. Moreover, a multi-query event stream processing engine is at the core of a wide range of applications including real-time data analytics, algorithmic trading, targeted advertisement, and (complex) event processing.
